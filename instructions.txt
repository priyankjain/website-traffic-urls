1. Install WAMP on your windows
2. Goto C:/wampp/www/ and extract the code files there
3. Make sure php curl extension is on and max_execution_time is 36000 and memory_limit is very high
4. Set the APi keys in config.php. Each computer should have different APi keys in config.php
5. Set the count in count.txt (This the value which will be appended to the longurl, so if count.txt contains 0, first http://example.com?0 would be shortened, http://example.com?1 would be shortened next, http://example.com?2 would be shortened next and so on)
IF you are setting up 3 computers to generate t.co links for http://example.com, count.txt should be 0 for one computer,
20000 for another computer and 40000 for the last one.
5. Execute the program by visiting http://localhost/website-traffic-urls
6. The t.co links would be output in the t.co links
7. Make sure that you allow the files would be written even after 15-20 minutes of closing the browser/tab, this is because there are some background processes writing to the file
