This is what I need the bot to achieve: -->

1. open http://securepasswordgenerator.net
2. clicking "generate"
3. copy the random password
4. Then open http://nourls.com
5. pasting that password into the custom url box
6. Type http://awesome.com in the upper URL box
7. click "shorten"
8. copy the new shortened url text
9. open twitter.com
10. tweet that shortened url
11. right click that tweeted shortened url
12. click "copy shortcut"
13. paste that shortcut to a notepad file
14. Loop it and append each url to the same file.
15. I want to run this process in 20 separate instances, but at the same time. So each instance would need to be using a different twitter account.

This will most likely be run on an extra computer, so cpu usage needs to be at a minimum. I know if built right, cpu usage wont be a problem, but using the imacros browser used up most of the cpu with just 2 instances. So please low cpu consumption is mandatory.

In the end, my goal is to have a notepad full of twitter urls that look like http://t.co/dUiwemKoi
